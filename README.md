# SoundCloud Uploader
A simple iOS app to record and upload sounds to your SoundCloud account.

This is a small but fully functional hobby project of mine. I figured that I needed an app to record guitar ideas on the go, and couldn't find something that did only that... So I made it!

It lacks a few basic features like session saving, API config, etc... but if you're interested, fork it and send me a pull-request :)

## Config

To use the SoundCloud API, you first need to create an App on your SoundCloud Developer account, and set up the keys on the project.

Simply go to http://soundcloud.com/you/apps and create your. Copy the ClientID and Client Secret to `SCUAppDelegate.m`. All set up! :)

## Known issues

- Compiles on iOS up to 8.4, but runs only up to the iOS iPhone 5 simulator.
